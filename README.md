# Safe-Trip-Analysis
Safe Trip Analysis - Ensemble classification on UK Accident Database


# Objectives

1) Data mining tasks for data preprocessing, data analysis and feature engineering

2) Time series forecasting using Facebookâ€™s Prophet and ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) to predict number of accidents

3) Classification model to classify the severity of accidents given the data of circumstances such as vehicle type, weather, road conditions.
